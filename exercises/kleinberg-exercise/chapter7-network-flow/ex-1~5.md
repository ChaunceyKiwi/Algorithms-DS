# Exercises for Chapter7

### Exercise1

Skippped but done.

### Exercise2
What is the value of this flow? Is this a maximum (s,t) flow in this graph? Find a minimum s-t cut in the flow network pictured in Figure 7.26, and also say what its capacity is.

#### Answer
The value of flow is 18. Not. The maximum is 21. The one with the source and top node.

### Exercise3
The same as above.

#### Answer
The value of flow is 10. Not. The maximum is 11. The one with the {d,t} as B and remains as A.

### Exercise4
Decide whether you think the following statement is true or false. If it is true, give a short explanation. If it is false, give a counterexample.

#### Answer
False when source can provide a huge capacity but the sink can only accept a little.

### Exercise5
Decide whether you think the following statement is true or false. If it is true, give a short explanation. If it is false, give a counterexample.

#### Answer
This is false. Consider a graph with node s, v1, v2, v3, w, t, edges (s, vi) and (vi,w) for each i, and an edge (w,t). There ia capacity of 4 on edge(w,t) and a capacity of 1 on all other edges. After adding the capacity increase from 4 to 6 rather than 5.
