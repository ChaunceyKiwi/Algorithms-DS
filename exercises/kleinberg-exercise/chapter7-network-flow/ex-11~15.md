### Exercise11
Skipped since has been done before.

### Exercise12The goal is to delete k edges so as to reduce the maximum s-t flow in G by as much as possible. In other words, you should find a set of edges F ⊆ E so that |F| = k and the maximum s-t flow in G′ = (V, E − F) is as small as possible subject to this.

Give a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this problem.

#### Answer
First observe that by removing any k edges in a graph, we reduce the capacity of any cut by at most k, and  so, the min-cut will reduce by at most k. Therefore, the max-flow will reduce by at most k. 

Now we show that one can in fact reduce the max-flow by k. To achieve this, we take a min-cut X and remove k edgs going out of it. The capacity of this cut will now become f-k, where f is the value of max-flow. There for, the min-cut becomes f-k, and so, the max-flow becomes f-k.
