# Exercises for Chapter6

### Exercise1
Find an independent set in a path G whose total weight is as large as possible.

#### Answer
a). With 6, 8, 6, 3, 6 : 8 + 6 < 6 + 6 + 6.

b). With 1, 8, 6, 3, 6 : Odd is 13, even is 11. Optimal is 14.

c). 

	opt(n) = { opt(n-1), opt(n-2) + w(n) }

### Exercise2
Given sets of values l1,l2,...,ln and h1,h2,...,hn, find a plan of maximum value. (Such a plan will be called optimal.)

#### Answer
a). [10 1 10; 5 50 1000]

b). 

	opt(n) = max{ opt(n-2) + h\_n, opt(n-1) + l\_n}

### Exercise3
Given an ordered graph G, find the length of the longest path that begins at v\_1 and ends at v\_n.

#### Answer
a). Conuter example: with vertices v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and edges (v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v5), (v3, v4), (v4, v5). Algorithm will give a path of length 2, while the optimal answer is 3.

b). 
	
	opt(1) = 0
	opt(i) = max_{1<=j<i, (j,i) in E} {opt(j) + 1}

### Exercise4
The problem. Given a value for the moving cost M, and sequences of operating costs N1,...,Nn and S1,...,Sn, find a plan of minimum cost. (Such a plan will be called optimal.)

#### Answer
a). It is obvious wrong if the moving cost is very high.

b). [1, 100, 1, 100; 100, 1, 100, 1], with moving cost as 10. The reason is that moving cost is relatively low compared with the cost it needs in a improper city.

c). 
	
	opt(n, 0) = Nn + min(opt(n-1, 0), M + opt(n-1, 1))
	opt(n, 1) = Sn + min(opt(n-1, 1), M + opt(n-1, 0))

### Exercise5

#### Answer
A bit confused, skipped for a moment.
