# To-do-list for Kleinberg Exercise

## Why make a list
It might not be realistic to finish all problems in Kleinberg exercises. And some topics are skipped in the class of CMPT405. I do not mean that the topic uncovered is meaningless. On the contrary, some topics uncovered is quite important like minimum spanning tree. However, due to the limitation on time and energy, I choose to focus on the topic which has been discussed in class so that the exercise can act as a strengthened training. I hope if I have enough time in the future I can make up the part I have skipped.

## To-do list

2. 1~51, lol, seems impossible to finish all of them. Try and read as many as possible.
